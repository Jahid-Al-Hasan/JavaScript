### Constructor
In JavaScript, both "function User(){}" and "function user(){}" can indeed work as constructors if they are called with the "new" keyword. JavaScript does not enforce naming conventions strictly, so technically, any function can act as a constructor when invoked with "new". However, the distinction in naming (PascalCase vs. camelCase) is a convention, not a requirement, and it's widely followed for readability and clarity.
